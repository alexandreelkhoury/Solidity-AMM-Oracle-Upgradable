# Betting Project (Upgradable, Oracle, AMM)


The goal of this project is to develop an application that allows:

- Betting on the price movement of a token for a predefined date.

- Fetching price data via an oracle.

- Implementing an Automated Market Maker (AMM) for exchanging the platform's token with ETH or BTC (or other cryptocurrencies).

- Implementing a proxy for upgrading the smart contract. You may choose the proxy implementation that best suits the project.

This project serves as a basic use case for Hardhat. It includes a sample contract, a corresponding test, and a deployment script for that contract.
